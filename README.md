#Control web browser with hand gesture
BY using machine learnning and Deep learning algorithm 
Controlling Web Browser via different hand gestures Introduction:- Web Browsers is a very common software application which we use every day, every hour. Use of technology can make use of web browsers more and easier. We know about hand gestures. Why not try hand gestures to control the browser itself? The Internet is growing at a very fast pace. The use of web browser is also growing. The Internet is a solution to everything. Now, everyone has at least 2-3 most frequently visited website. Now, what if visits on those sites can be made simpler? I have tried to address the current situation and tried to make the use of a web browser easier. Objective:- The Objective of my hack is to design a robust and efficient system which will be able to control the browser via hand gestures i.e. different hand gestures will be assigned to different sites. So, if we show a particular hand gesture, a particular site will open up in a new tab. How it is better than the current system? Everyone has some sites which are used very frequently. For example:- If someone is fond of social media, he/she can assign different hand gestures for sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and youtube. So, instead of typing the whole site name, you would be able to open the site in a new tab with just a hand gesture.
