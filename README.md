Control web browser with hand gesture

BY using machine learnning and Deep learning algorithm. 
Controlling Web Browser via different hand gestures Introduction:- Web Browsers is a very common software application which we use every day, every hour. Use of technology can make use of web browsers more and easier. We know about hand gestures.
Why not try hand gestures to control the browser itself? The Internet is growing at a very fast pace. The use of web browser is also growing. The Internet is a solution to everything. 
Now, everyone has at least 2-3 most frequently visited website. Now, what if visits on those sites can be made simpler? I have tried to address the current situation and tried to make the use of a web browser easier. 
Objective:- The Objective of my hack is to design a robust and efficient system which will be able to control the browser via hand gestures i.e. different hand gestures will be assigned to different sites. So, if we show a particular hand gesture, a particular site will open up in a new tab. How it is better than the current system? Everyone has some sites which are used very frequently. 
For example:- If someone is fond of social media, he/she can assign different hand gestures for sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and youtube. So, instead of typing the whole site name, you would be able to open the site in a new tab with just a hand gesture.

Idea: I plan to design a system to solve above problem using image processing techniques and controlling the browser using hand gestures. At, first the user needs to enter the sites which he/she frequently visits and needs to control those sites using hand gestures. A user needs to enter the site names for the particular hand gestures. Thatâ€™s all, the user can now control the browser, open sites in new tabs using hand gesture and can even close the browser using the hand gesture. Thus, a hand gesture controlled browser is made. In this way a user can easily open the sites which he/she wants in the new tab using the hand gesture. SnapShots:-
